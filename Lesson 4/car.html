                A <b>car</b> , or an automobile, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle"> motor
                    vehicle</a> with wheels.
                Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, <br>
                seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport <br>
                people, not cargo. <sup> <a href="">[1]</a> </sup> [2] French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot <br>
                built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-
                born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and
                constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.

                The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday
                use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented
                his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely
                available during the 20th century. One of the first cars
                affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American
                car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.

               <h2>Etymology</h2>

            <p>The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old
                North
                French) Middle English carre
                "two-wheeled cart", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot".[14][15] It originally
                referred
                to any wheeled horse-drawn
                vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.[16][17]</p>
