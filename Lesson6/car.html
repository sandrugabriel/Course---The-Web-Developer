        A <b>car</b> , or an automobile, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle"> motor vehicle</a> with wheels.
        Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads,
        seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport
        people, not cargo.[1][2] French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot
        built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-
        born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and
        constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.

        The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday
        use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented
        his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely
        available during the 20th century. One of the first cars
        affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American
        car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>

    <p>The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North
        French) Middle English carre
        "two-wheeled cart", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot".[14][15] It originally referred
        to any wheeled horse-drawn
        vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.[16][17]</p>
