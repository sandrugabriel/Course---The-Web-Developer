        A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily
        on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.[1][2] French
        inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss
        inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in
        1808.

        The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor
        Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century.
        One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford
        Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe and
        other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[4] The car is
        considered an essential part of the developed economy.

        Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades, additional
        features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include
        rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the
        early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric
        cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are
        predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025.[5][6] The transition from fossil fuel-powered
        cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[7] such as Project
        Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[8]

        There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest
        payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees,
        taxes, and insurance.[9] The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air
        pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic
        collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[10] Personal benefits include on-demand
        transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[11] Societal benefits include economic benefits, such
        as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from
        leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from
        place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[12] There are around one billion cars
        in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized
        countries.[13]

        Etymology
        The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North
        French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled cart", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros
        "chariot".[14][15] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or
        wagon.[16][17]

        "Motor car", attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English.[2] "Autocar", a variant likewise
        attested from 1895 and literally meaning "self-propelled car", is now considered archaic.[18] "Horseless
        carriage" is attested from 1895.[19]

        "Automobile", a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek autós (αὐτός) "self" and Latin mobilis "movable",
        entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.[20] It fell
        out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America,[21] where the abbreviated form "auto"
        commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like "auto industry" and "auto mechanic".[22][23]

        The first steam-powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in
        China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre-long (26 in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to
        carry a driver or a passenger.[11][26][27] It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully
        built or run.[27]

        Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle
        in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[28] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French
        Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.[28] His inventions were
        limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.[28] In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and
        demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a
        steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of
        little practical use.

        The development of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often
        treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during
        the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. In the
        United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.

        In 1807, Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion
        engine (which they called a Pyréolophore), but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France.[29]
        Coincidentally, in 1807, the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own "de Rivaz internal
        combustion engine", and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The
        Niépces' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant),
        finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and
        oxygen.[29] Neither design was successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and
        Etienne Lenoir,[30] who each built vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion
        engines.[31]

        In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated a three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the
        International Exposition of Electricity.[32] Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb
        Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on cars at about the same time, the year 1886 is
        regarded as the birth year of the modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—when the German
        Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the
        car.[31][33][34]

        In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other
        inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen
        was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29
        January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began
        promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his
        first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of
        his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to
        his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in
        France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888, Bertha Benz, the wife of Carl Benz, undertook
        the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.
